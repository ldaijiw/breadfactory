# TDD Bread Factory

## Summary

TDD bread factory is the latest bread brand in Py Land. It always produces the best bread because it has the best testing strategy!

What they do is before they make any new bread, they make a test to make sure the end output is correct. Then they adjust the recipe until it's just right!

You are going to do the same with bread! This is called Test Driven Development.

## Tasks

This exercise is going to bring together lots of concepts.

### Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes include:
- git
- github
- functions
- TDD
- Separation of concerns - this is important do not ignore!
- DRY code
- DOD


## Installing and running
To run the naan factory do the following:

```python
import naan factory
run factory()
```


### TDD - test driven development

1. write the test
2. run it, and read the error
3. code and make it pass the test

this helps with:
- Stop over engineering
- Maintainable code
- Reduce technical debt
- Goes well with agile and working code
- errors can be your guide in complex systems

How it works is that we write unit tests.

##### Unit Tests

Test single pieces of code. Like a function.

**base of a test**
Usually has 3 phases.
- setup phase (know variables)
- calling of the function / piece of code with know variables
- asserting for expect output




### User stories for Naan Factory

```
#1
As a user, I can use the make dough with 'water' and 'flour' to make 'dough'.

#2
As a user, I can use the bake dough with dough to get naan.

#3
As a user, I can user the run factory with water and flour and get naan.

```
